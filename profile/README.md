# E-Traxx Formula Student ‚Äî Engineering Hub

## Overview
This GitHub organization is the central hub for all **software, firmware, and tooling** developed by the **E-Traxx Formula Student Team** from D√ºsseldorf.  
Everything that runs, logs, or simulates our race car lives here ‚Äî from embedded control firmware to Python utilities, simulation models, and data pipelines.

---

## Purpose
Our goal is to keep every part of the E-Traxx software ecosystem **open, structured, and connected**.  
Each repository under this organization contributes to one or more of these pillars:

- **Embedded Systems** ‚Äî ECU/VCU firmware (PULSAR, NOVA) and BMS software (BAT-MAN) built for reliability, safety, and performance  
- **Developer Tools** ‚Äî Build systems, flashing utilities, and internal frameworks (Pitlane, dev-tools)  
- **Telemetry & Diagnostics** ‚Äî Real-time data pipelines, visualization dashboards, and analysis tools (TelemX, Oracle)  
- **Battery & Power Systems** ‚Äî HV accumulator logic, isolation checks, and balancing control  
- **Simulation & Modeling** ‚Äî MATLAB/Simulink control design, data post-processing, and performance estimation  
- **Communication & Data** ‚Äî CAN databases (DBC), network protocols, and shared configuration files  
---

## Development Philosophy
We design software that is:
- **Modular** ‚Äî clear separation of firmware, tools, and models  
- **Maintainable** ‚Äî structured repos and documentation standards  
- **Interoperable** ‚Äî common data formats and communication layers (CAN, JSON, telemetry)  

This organization ensures that anyone on the team ‚Äî or in future seasons ‚Äî can build, flash, test, or simulate with minimal friction.
